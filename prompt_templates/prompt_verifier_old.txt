Given the observations of a sampled action plan in the sequences of images (3 images for the beginning, the middle and the last step), you are an external verifier. 
Help the robot agent describe the action plan in text and determines whether it achieves the subtask: {TASK_INSTRUCTION}. 
Note:
1. Please pay attention to the robot gripper in the last image as it shows where the robot gripper interacts. 
2. Please pay attention to the spatial location of the objects. Don't mistake the background objects as the object the gripper interacts with.
3. Your output should include the verification that has the format of "Verification: Success" or "Verification: Failure".
