Given the observation images of a sampled action plan (the first image is the initial state, the second image is the final state from the agent view and the last image is the the final state from wrist view), you are an external verifier. Help the robot agent describe the action and determine if it achieves the specified subtask.
Subtask: {TASK_INSTRUCTION}.
Your verification must follow this logical process:
Identify the target object in the first image. The target object is present in the scene and may not be entirely visible due to occulsion. Describe where it is located. 
If the subtask is about picking, analyze both the wrist view and the agent view of the final state to check:
a) Is the robot's gripper holding an object?
If the subtask is about placing, analyze the wrist view and the agent view of the final state to check:
b) Is the object in/on the target place? If object being placed is not clearly visible, you can check which object disappear from the table.
If the subtask is about closing, analyze the wrist view and the agent view of the final state to check:
c) Is the object fully closed?
Determine the outcome based on this intermediate thinking.
Finally, provide your verification in the format "Verification: Success" or "Verification: Failure".
